## General info

Project was Time Series Analysis, used ARIMA method to build the model.
Major steps involved were as follow :                                 
* STEP: 1 - Data Cleaning and Analysis
* STEP: 2 - Transformation
* STEP: 3 - Checking Stationarity (ADF Test)   
* STEP: 4 - Differencing
* STEP: 5 - Time Series Components 
* STEP: 6 - Finding ACF and PACF
* STEP: 7 - ARIMA 
* STEP: 8 - Forecast


## Methods and Tools

* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook
* ARIMA
* Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
* ACF and PACF
* Statsmodels
* yfinance

## Mean absolute percentage error
Mean absolute percentage error = 7.06

 
## Status
Project is: _finished_.

## Conclusion
We cannot solely depend on ARIMA model for to predict stock values, as stock prices are very unpredictable and it is not necessary forecasting will give best result everytime, as simplistic nature of ARIMA model motivate us to implement it to understand the market/stock behaviour.
